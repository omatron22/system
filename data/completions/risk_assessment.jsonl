{"group_id": "risk_assessment", "model": "deepseek-llm", "answer": "1. There are no risk factors in the High-Risk category. The maximum value for \"prob\" is 9 and the minimum value is 1, while the maximum value for \"impact\" is 1 and the minimum value is 9. Therefore, there can't be any factor with a high impact or probability.\n2. Since there are no risk factors in the High-Risk category, it is not possible to reduce or mitigate the probability of any high-risk factors.\n3. Similarly, since there are no risk factors in the High-Risk category, it is also not possible to reduce or mitigate the impact of any high-risk factors.\n4. The overall risk impact on the strategy cannot be determined as there are no risk factors in the High-Risk category.\n5. It's not possible to enhance your strategic position while maintaining or lowering the overall risk profile, because there are no risk factors in the High-Risk category.\n6. This question is not applicable since it requires information about leadership/board/shareholders' openness towards more-risky strategies and this data table does not provide such information.\n7. The risk-reward ratio for any strategic shifts cannot be determined as there are no risk factors in the High-Risk category, therefore we don't have enough information to calculate it."}
