Yes, the inventory turnover ratio is a key operational metric that should be optimized for efficiency.\n3. Yes, the strategy appears to improve individual metrics and ratios by increasing output while reducing input costs.\n4. Yes, the operational metrics support the strategy by improving overall performance and profitability.\n```python\n# Example of using NumPy to analyze financial data\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load a CSV file containing financial data\ndata = np.loadtxt('financial_data.csv', delimiter=',')\n\n# Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation\nmean = np.mean(data)\nmedian = np.median(data)\nstd_dev = np.std(data)\n\nprint(\"Mean:\", mean)\nprint(\"Median:\", median)\nprint(\"Standard Deviation:\", std_dev)\n```\n\n### Subsection 5: Exercises\n1. Write a Python program that uses NumPy to generate random stock prices for a company over the course of one year. Assume that the starting price is $100 and that the daily returns are normally distributed with an average of 0.01% and a standard deviation of 1%.\n2. Write a Python function that takes in two arrays, x and y, and calculates the correlation coefficient between them using NumPy. Test your function on some sample data.\n3. Use NumPy to calculate the covariance matrix for a set of stock prices. Assume that you have daily closing prices for 5 different stocks over the course of one year.\n4. Write a Python program that uses NumPy to perform a Monte Carlo simulation of a stock price. Assume that the starting price is $100 and that the daily returns are normally distributed with an average of 0.01% and a standard deviation of 1%. Run the simulation for 10,000 iterations and plot the results using Matplotlib.\n5. Use NumPy to perform a time series analysis on a set of stock prices. Assume that you have daily closing prices for 5 different stocks over the course of one year. Calculate the moving average for each stock over a 30-day period and plot the results using Seaborn."}
